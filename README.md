# e-commerce
E-Commerce is a simple, clean, mock store design done as a project for my databases course.

### Demo
A live version of this demo site can be seen [here](http://ruffner.ddns.net/e-commerce). Photo cred to my dad.

### Usage
This site is built on Google's [Web Components](https://elements.polymer-project.org/). 

[Bower](http://bower.io/) is used to manage these packages. Needed elements are defined in ```bower.json``` and may be installed by running ```bower update```. This creates the ```bower_components/``` directory containing needed dependencies.
